# stackr.sh
This script creates some repetitive tasks for you, like:
* Creates a linux user 
* Installs base packages for your Ubuntu VM
* Installs git-review, creates ssh keys and basic config to start contributing upstream
* Install Devstack

You can use this script with cloud-init or executing the script yourself.

## Cloud init
If you are using cloud-init: make sure to modify the variables at the beggining of the script.

```
# Linux user
user=
# Your gerrit username
gerrit_username=
# Your email address 
gerrit_email=
# Your FUll Name (USE DOUBLE QUOTES)
gerrit_fullname=
# Install Devstack 
with_devstack=1
# Devstack Installation Path
devstack_path=/opt/devstack
```

## Standalone mode 
If you are executing the script from command-line (./stackr.sh) then you can pass the options
using named parameters. To learn more about the script usage do this:
 
```
# ./stackr.sh -h

Usage: ./stackr.sh [OPTIONS]

--user=user                 Linux user
--gerrit-username=username  Gerrit username
--gerrit-email=email        Gerrit email address
--gerrit-fullname=fullname  Your Full name (Use double quotes if spaces between names)
--with-devstack             Install devstack (default is yes)
--devstack-path=path        Devstack installation path (default is /opt/devstak)

```
