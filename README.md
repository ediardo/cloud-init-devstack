This script creates some repetitive tasks for you, like:
* Creates a linux user 
* Installs base packages for your Ubuntu VM
* Installs git-review, creates ssh keys and basic config to start contributing upstream
* Install Devstack

You can use this script with cloud-init or executing the script yourself.

If you are using cloud-init: make sure to modify the variables at the beggining of the script

If you are executing the script from command-line (./stackr.sh) then you can pass the options
using named parameters. To learn more about the script usage do this:
 
```
./stackr.sh -h
```
